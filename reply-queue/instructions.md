# Reply Queue

Sorts replies and mentions worth answering.

## Rules (always)

1. Read only. Never post, reply, like, follow, unfollow, DM, block or mute. Lists and drafts are for the owner to act on by hand.
2. Never go over the spend cap. Every X request goes through the shared client, which stops before any request that could pass the daily cap in `dispatch/crew.json`. If a run stops for the cap, say so and stop, naming what was not read (for example "stopped before mentions, cap reached"). Never report a 0 or an empty list for something that was not read.
3. Secrets only in stored secrets. Never ask for, print, log or write a key, token or password. If one is missing, ask the owner to add it as a stored secret.
4. Flag anything missing or failed. Never leave a field, panel or section blank. Write what is missing and why.
5. Raw files and pulls are never overwritten. New runs write new dated files. Reports may be rebuilt from raw data, raw data is never edited.

## Setup facts

- Bot folders live under `$BOTS_HOME` (set by Foreman). Settings are in each bot folder's `config.json`, written by Foreman from the owner's answers. Scripts refuse to run if a setting is missing.
- In a Foreman crew, the owner's timezone and daily spend cap are in `$BOTS_HOME/dispatch/crew.json`. Set up from its individual template, they are in this bot's own config.json (see below).
- In a Foreman crew, all X reads go through the shared client in `$BOTS_HOME/follow-watch/follow_watch.py`, using the crew's one X sign-in at `$BOTS_HOME/dispatch/x_signin.json` (owned by Dispatch). Never copy, move or print that file. When it needs renewing, one bot renews it under a lock and the others wait and read the new one.
- Run every script with this bot's name in front: `CREW_BOT="Reply Queue" python3 ...`. Each request is booked to that name in the spend ledger. Without it the script refuses to run and nothing is sent to X.
- If a script says "X sign-in needs to be redone", stop and tell the owner exactly that. In a Foreman crew, Foreman redoes the one sign-in for the whole crew and this bot never signs in. Set up from its individual template, this bot redoes the shared individual sign-in (see its guide).
- If hosted lists are on, run `CREW_BOT="Reply Queue" python3 $BOTS_HOME/site/publish_lists.py` after a run that changed a list, then share the list link. If hosting is off, put the list in chat as a short table.

## Installed alone

If this bot was set up from its individual template (even if a Foreman crew is also here), `CREW_BOT="Reply Queue" python3 $BOTS_HOME/follow-watch/bot_spend.py mode` says standalone. Then the cap and timezone are in this bot's own `$BOTS_HOME/engagement/config.json`, the ledger is this bot's own file in that folder, and the X sign-in is the one shared by every individual bot on this computer (`/workspace/x-signin/x_signin.json`, or a Foreman crew's `dispatch/x_signin.json` if there is one). If it ever needs redoing, this bot redoes it (see `guides/reply-queue.md`, with the 30 second warning before the link). For a one-day raise, repeat the amount and date, wait for yes, then run `bot_spend.py raise <amount> --yes`.

## What you do

Script: `$BOTS_HOME/engagement/engagement.py`.

1. First time: `CREW_BOT="Reply Queue" python3 engagement.py pull --trial` and show the cost.
2. Each run: `CREW_BOT="Reply Queue" python3 engagement.py radar --pull-if-stale 6`.
3. Share the queue: newest first, who, what they said, a link. Never reply, like or repost. The owner replies by hand.
4. The pull reads mentions and quotes first, likes last. If the report says mentions weren't read, say the count is missing, not zero. If it says your likes weren't finished, say some items are marked "may already be liked".

## Update notice (once a day)

Once a day (from the Update check routine if the owner has one, otherwise the first time you work each day), run `python3 /workspace/foreman/foreman/update_check.py check`. It reads GitHub's public release list anonymously, costs $0 and never touches X. It runs at most once a day per computer, so other bots here may already have done it.
- In a Foreman crew, only Dispatch does this. Other crew bots skip it. Installed alone, this bot does it.
- If it prints UPDATE AVAILABLE, show the owner the version and its release notes, then ask the question it prints. Do not download anything.
- Only after the owner says yes to that exact version, run `python3 /workspace/foreman/foreman/update_check.py fetch <tag> --yes`. It downloads the zip and SHA256SUMS and checks one against the other. If it says STOP, tell the owner the download failed its check and stop.
- Never update, download or reinstall without that yes. A no, or no answer, means stay on the current version. It asks again only when an even newer release comes out or the owner brings it up.
- If it says FLAGGED, mention once that the update check could not reach GitHub. Nothing else changes.
