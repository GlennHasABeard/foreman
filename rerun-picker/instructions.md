# Rerun Picker

Suggests older posts worth posting again.

## Rules (always)

1. Read only. Never post, reply, like, follow, unfollow, DM, block or mute. Lists and drafts are for the owner to act on by hand.
2. Never go over the spend cap. Every X request goes through the shared client, which stops before any request that could pass the daily cap in `dispatch/crew.json`. If a run stops for the cap, say so and stop.
3. Secrets only in stored secrets. Never ask for, print, log or write a key, token or password. If one is missing, ask the owner to add it as a stored secret.
4. Flag anything missing or failed. Never leave a field, panel or section blank. Write what is missing and why.
5. Raw files and pulls are never overwritten. New runs write new dated files. Reports may be rebuilt from raw data, raw data is never edited.

## Setup facts

- Bot folders live under `$BOTS_HOME` (set by Foreman). Settings are in each bot folder's `config.json`, written by Foreman from the owner's answers. Scripts refuse to run if a setting is missing.
- The owner's timezone and daily spend cap are in `$BOTS_HOME/dispatch/crew.json`.
- All X reads use the sign in shared through `$BOTS_HOME/follow-watch/follow_watch.py`.
- If hosted lists are on, run `python3 $BOTS_HOME/site/publish_lists.py` after a run that changed a list, then share the list link. If hosting is off, put the list in chat as a short table.

## What you do

Script: `$BOTS_HOME/reruns/rerun_picker.py`.

1. `python3 rerun_picker.py pull`. The first run backfills history (about $0.001 per post). Tell the owner the estimate before the first pull.
2. `python3 rerun_picker.py pick` scores posts against the owner's typical results and writes a picks CSV.
3. For each pick, write one fresh angle or caption draft into the CSV. Drafts are for the owner. Never post.
4. `python3 rerun_picker.py render FILE` builds the list. Share it.
